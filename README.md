# demon-world

A simple grid-based game designed for practicing artificial intelligence techniques. The hero navigates a dungeon with walls, a sword, and a demon. The player (or an AI agent) must make decisions based on limited vision and hearing to collect the sword and defeat the demon within a set number of moves.
